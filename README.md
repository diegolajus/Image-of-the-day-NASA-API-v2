This application allows you to see what NASA considers the best image of the day. I've implemented a couple of features that give the app a bit more life such as a date search engine to navigate through the days, months, years ... and also a quick call to the YouTube API that will return 2 videos in realtion with the Picture of the Day.

If you like topics related to cosmology or photography, be careful, it's highly addictive. The furthest date you can reach that contains an image is June 20, 1995 and the most recent date is today (if today's image is not published yet, it will show the one from the previous day)
